The sorting function you provided is a variant of the  " Dutch National Flag Algorithm ", which is used to sort an array containing only three distinct values. In this particular case, it appears to be sorting an array of colors, typically represented as 0s, 1s, and 2s (commonly used in LeetCode's "Sort Colors" problem).

### Key Characteristics
Problem Type:  

    Three-way partitioning sort (like sorting 0s, 1s, and 2s).
Sorting Technique: 

    It uses multiple pointers (i, j, and index) to partition the array.
Time Complexity: 
    ùëÇ
    (
    ùëõ
    )
    O(n) because it makes a single pass through the array for each color (0, 1, and 2), which is still linear.
    
Space Complexity: 
    ùëÇ
    (

    )
    O(1) since it performs sorting in place.
    Explanation of the Algorithm
    The array is partitioned into regions of 0s, 1s, and 2s.

Pointers:

    i: Position where the current "color" should be placed.
    j: The current element being inspected.
    index: Marks the end of the current region of sorted elements for a particular color.

Color Tracking:

    The variable color tracks which of the 3 values (0, 1, or 2) is currently being placed in its correct position.

Logic:
For every color, the loop scans the array and places it in the correct section.
When the scan for the current color is complete (j reaches the end of the array), it moves to the next color (color++).
The pointers i and j are reset to index so that the scan resumes from where the last color's region ended.
